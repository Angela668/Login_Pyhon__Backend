# Login_Pyhon__Backend
# This is tafe school project about a simple login program with a menu of options, it is written by Python: 
This program acts as a secure user account manager. Users can log in with existing credentials or register new accounts. Registration allows for choosing a personal password or having a secure one generated with options for character types and length. Account information is stored safely in a file named "accounts.txt". Additionally, administrators have the privilege to view all registered accounts within the system. The program exits gracefully after a brief delay for a smooth user experience.
